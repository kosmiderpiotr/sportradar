## Coding exercise for sportradar 

As instructed i've try to keep it simple and funlly functional at the same time.
Scoreboard class is a main class of the project which contains inmemory collection of matches.
Match class is immutable because when returning from scoreboard score could be changed.
Team and CounryEnum is rendundant and could be replace by simple string, but I think this looks better and in the future
can contains team players.
In my opinion Score can be also class and in the future could contains for instance time of score or player who made this score


Hope I can talk about me and my probramming skills in an online meeting.
